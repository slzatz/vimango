Research Topic/Instructions:
%s

Please structure your response as a detailed markdown document with:
1. Executive Summary
2. Key Findings (with sections and subsections as appropriate)  
3. Different Perspectives/Viewpoints
4. Current Status/Latest Developments
5. Implications and Analysis
6. Sources and References

IMPORTANT - You have access to both web search and web fetch tools:
1. **First**: Use web search to discover and evaluate sources on multiple aspects of this topic
2. **Then**: Use web fetch to access complete content from the most promising sources for deeper analysis
3. **Prioritize web fetch for**: Scientific papers, botanical databases, official plant guides, comprehensive articles, authoritative sources with detailed information
4. **Combine tools effectively**: Search provides breadth, fetch provides depth - use both for comprehensive coverage
5. **Citations**: Cite your sources clearly with URLs, especially for fetched content
6. **Goal**: Provide a thorough analysis that combines broad discovery (search) with deep document analysis (fetch) suitable for someone who needs complete understanding of this topic.

Use web fetch liberally on high-quality sources to provide the most comprehensive research possible.

content, err := os.ReadFile("hello.txt")
	if err != nil {
		// If an error occurs, print it and exit.
		fmt.Printf("Error reading file: %v\n", err)
		return
	}

	// The returned content is a byte slice ([]byte).
	// To use it as a string, you must convert it.
	fileContentAsString := string(content)

	// Print the string. All newlines, tabs, and other
	// characters are preserved exactly as they were.
	fmt.Println(fileContentAsString)

content, err := os.ReadFile("yourfile.txt")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Convert the byte slice to a string.
	// This conversion does not alter the content.
	// Line feeds, tabs, etc., are all preserved.
	fileAsString := string(content)
