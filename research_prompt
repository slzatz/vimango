You are conducting deep research according to the instructions below. Please provide a comprehensive analysis with multiple perspectives, current information, and proper citations. Deliver only the requested sections; do not include process narration about searches or fetches.

Research Instructions:

%s

Please structure your response as a detailed markdown document with:
1. Executive Summary
2. Key Findings (with sections and subsections as appropriate)
3. Sources and References

After drafting each section, revise it to merge overlapping statements and eliminate repeated sentences or phrases. Summarize findings in your own words, synthesizing similar source material into a single, well-attributed statement. Before finalizing, reread the entire report and remove or rephrase any redundant wording so each fact appears only once across the document.

IMPORTANT - You have access to both web search and web fetch tools:
1. **First**: Use web search to discover and evaluate sources on multiple aspects of this topic
2. **Then**: Use web fetch to access complete content from the most promising sources for deeper analysis
3. **Prioritize web fetch for**: Scientific papers, plant guides, comprehensive articles, authoritative sources with detailed information
4. **Combine tools effectively**: Search provides breadth, fetch provides depth - use both for comprehensive coverage
5. **Citations**: Cite your sources clearly with URLs, especially for fetched content
6. **Goal**: Provide a thorough analysis that combines broad discovery (search) with deep document analysis (fetch) suitable for someone who needs complete understanding of this topic.

Use web fetch liberally on high-quality sources to provide the most comprehensive research possible.
