# GoVim Implementation TODO List

This document tracks the planned work and priorities for the pure Go vim implementation.

## High Priority Tasks

1. **Adapter Layer Implementation**
   - [x] Design interface-based adapter layer

   - [x] Create CGO and Go implementation wrappers
   - [x] Add configuration options for switching implementations
   - [x] Complete API layer (all vim functions)
   - [x] Update all application code to use new API
     - [x] Update organizer_*.go files
     - [x] Update editor_process_key.go
     - [x] Update editor_cmd_line.go
     - [x] Update editor_methods.go
     - [x] Update editor_normal.go
     - [x] Update organizer.go
     - [x] Update dbfunc.go
     - [x] Verify app.go already uses new adapter API

2. **Complete Basic Motion Set**
   - [x] Implement `e` (end of word)
   - [x] Implement `^` (first non-blank character)
   - [x] Implement `gg` (go to first line)
   - [x] Add support for motion counts (2j, 5w, etc.)
   - [x] Fix cursor positioning in normal and insert modes
   - [x] Improve arrow key handling
   - [x] Fix end-of-line cursor behavior

3. **Text Editing Commands**
   - [x] Implement delete (d + motion)
   - [x] Implement change (c + motion)
   - [x] Implement yank (y + motion)
   - [x] Implement put (p, P)
   - [x] Implement line deletion (dd)
   - [x] Implement line change (cc)
   - [x] Add support for x (delete character)
   - [x] Add support for o/O (open line below/above)
   - [x] Add support for I/A (insert at beginning/end of line)
   - [x] Implement J (join lines)

4. **Mode Transitions**
   - [x] Fix Escape key handling for all modes
   - [x] Improve mode transition between normal and insert modes
   - [x] Fix cursor positioning during mode transitions
   - [x] Add visual mode operations (d, y, c)
   - [x] Add visual mode indentation (< and >)

5. **Search Functionality**
   - [x] Implement `/` and `?` search
   - [x] Implement `n` and `N` for next/prev match
   - [ ] Add search highlighting support

6. **Error Handling**
   - [x] Add robust error handling in buffer operations
   - [x] Improve file loading error handling
   - [x] Add recovery mechanisms for common operations

7. **Integration Testing**
   - [ ] Create comparison tests between C and Go implementations
   - [ ] Add benchmark tests to compare performance

## Medium Priority Tasks

1. **Ex Commands**
   - [ ] Implement core set of Ex commands
   - [ ] Add support for Ex command history

2. **Advanced Editing**
   - [ ] Implement text objects (word, sentence, paragraph)
   - [ ] Add support for registers
   - [ ] Implement undo/redo functionality

3. **Visual Mode Enhancements**
   - [ ] Add line-visual mode (Shift+V)
   - [ ] Add block-visual mode (Ctrl+V)
   - [ ] Implement operations on visual selections

4. **Marks and Jumps**
   - [ ] Implement marks
   - [ ] Add jump list functionality

## Lower Priority Tasks

1. **Macros**
   - [ ] Record and playback macros

2. **Window Management**
   - [ ] Support for multiple windows/splits

3. **Advanced Features**
   - [ ] Auto-indent
   - [ ] Syntax highlighting integration
   - [ ] Auto-completion

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Optimize buffer operations
   - [ ] Add benchmarks
   - [ ] Profile and improve hotspots

## Known Issues

- ~~Cursor positioning at end of lines needs verification~~ (Fixed May 2025)
- ~~Visual mode selection tracking could be improved~~ (Improved May 2025)
- ~~Buffer content persistence between context switches~~ (Fixed May 2025)
- Tests needed for edge cases (empty buffers, special characters)
- Line wrapping not yet implemented
- Auto-indentation not yet implemented
- Syntax highlighting integration pending

## Migration Plan

1. Implement core functionality in Go
2. Add tests to verify behavior matches C implementation
3. Create adapter for seamless switching
4. Switch components one by one to Go implementation 
5. Remove CGO dependency when all components are working
