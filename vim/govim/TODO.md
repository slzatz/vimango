## Known Issues

- ~~Cursor positioning at end of lines needs verification~~ (Fixed May 2025)
- ~~Visual mode selection tracking could be improved~~ (Improved May 2025)
- ~~Buffer content persistence between context switches~~ (Fixed May 2025)
- Tests needed for edge cases (empty buffers, special characters)
- Unexpected behavior with long lines (no text wrapping)
- Missing most text-object based operations
- Limited register functionality (only unnamed register)
- No undo/redo support

## Implementation Status Summary

The current Go vim implementation successfully handles:
- Basic cursor movement and navigation
- Simple editing operations
- Mode switching
- Basic visual mode
- Fundamental search functionality

However, it lacks several key vim features that will be the focus of the next development phase,
as detailed in the "High Priority Features For Next Phase" section above.

## Migration Plan

1. Implement core functionality in Go
2. Add tests to verify behavior matches C implementation
3. Create adapter for seamless switching
4. Switch components one by one to Go implementation 
5. Remove CGO dependency when all components are working
