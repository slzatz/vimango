# GoVim Implementation Progress

This document tracks the current progress of the pure Go vim implementation.

## Current Status (April 2025)

We've begun implementation of a pure Go version of libvim to replace the current CGO implementation. Our approach is to create a parallel implementation that can eventually replace the CGO code without disrupting the current functionality.

### Implemented Components

1. **Core Data Structures**:
   - Buffer management (`GoBuffer`)
   - Engine state management (`GoEngine`)
   - Cursor positioning

2. **Basic Motion Commands**:
   - h, j, k, l (left, down, up, right)
   - 0, $ (start/end of line)
   - ^ (first non-blank character)
   - w, b (word forward/backward)
   - e (end of word)
   - G (go to last line)
   - gg (go to first line)
   - % (matching bracket navigation)
   - Motion counts (e.g., 5j, 3w)

3. **Text Editing Commands**:
   - Delete operations (d + motion, dd)
   - Change operations (c + motion, cc)
   - Yank and put (y + motion, p, P)

4. **Search Functionality**:
   - Forward search (/)
   - Backward search (?)
   - Next/previous match navigation (n, N)
   - Multiple match handling with wraparound

5. **Mode Support**:
   - Normal mode
   - Insert mode (basic implementation)
   - Visual mode (basic implementation)
   - Search mode

6. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for motion commands
   - Mode transition tests
   - Tests for editing operations
   - Tests for search functionality

### Architecture

- `interfaces.go`: Defines the interfaces for the Go implementation
- `buffer.go`: Implements the buffer functionality
- `engine.go`: Core engine implementation with mode handling
- `normal_mode_motion.go`: Normal mode motion command implementations
- `wrapper.go`: Compatibility wrapper to match the C API
- `adapter.go`: In parent package, provides switching between implementations

## Next Steps

1. **Complete The Adapter Layer**:
   - ✅ Updated organizer_*.go files to use the new adapter API
   - ✅ Updated editor_process_key.go to use new adapter API
   - ✅ Updated editor_cmd_line.go to use new adapter API
   - ✅ Updated editor_methods.go to use new adapter API
   - ✅ Updated editor_normal.go to use new adapter API
   - ✅ Updated organizer.go to use new adapter API
   - ✅ Updated dbfunc.go to use new adapter API
   - ✅ Verified app.go already uses new adapter API
   - Test switching between C and Go implementations using the --go-vim flag

2. **Further Enhance Go Implementation**:
   - Implement remaining Ex commands 
   - Enhance the search functionality with highlighting
   - Add registers for yank/put operations
   - Implement text objects

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Create comparison tests between Go and C implementations
   - Ensure behavior is identical in edge cases
   - Add benchmarks to compare performance

4. **Advanced Features**:
   - Implement macros
   - Add support for marks
   - Implement advanced text editing operations

## Using the Go Implementation

The new adapter layer provides a clean way to switch between the C and Go implementations:

```go
// At application startup
vim.Configure(vim.Config{UseGoImplementation: true})

// Check which implementation is active
if vim.IsUsingGoImplementation() {
    fmt.Println("Using Go implementation")
} else {
    fmt.Println("Using C implementation")
}

// Toggle between implementations
vim.ToggleImplementation()

// All API calls are the same regardless of implementation
buffer := vim.NewBuffer(0)
vim.SetCurrentBuffer(buffer)
```

You can also use the command-line flag to choose the implementation at startup:

```bash
./vimango --go-vim   # Use the Go implementation
./vimango           # Use the C implementation (default)
```

## Known Limitations

The current implementation has the basic functionality but lacks several advanced vim features:

### Missing Major Features

- No support for multiple registers (only the unnamed register)
- Text objects (iw, aw, etc.) not implemented
- Missing most advanced motions (f, F, t, T, (, ), {, }), but % implemented for bracket matching
- Limited visual mode (no line or block visual modes)
- No marks or jump list
- No macro recording/playback
- Limited ex command support
- No folding functionality

### Prioritized Development

See the TODO.md file for a detailed list of missing features and their implementation priority. The next phase of development will focus on:

1. Implementing a registers system
2. Adding text objects support
3. Adding more advanced motions
4. Completing visual mode implementation
5. Implementing marks and jump list

## Recent Updates (May 2025)

1. **Undo/Redo Functionality**:
   - Implemented full undo/redo functionality with 'u' and Ctrl-r commands
   - Added proper handling of insert mode changes as a single undo operation
   - Implemented special handling for 'o' and 'O' commands to ensure correct line removal on undo
   - Added cursor position tracking and restoration during undo/redo operations
   - Implemented command grouping for complex operations
   - Added robust state tracking to maintain buffer consistency

2. **Arrow Key Handling**:
   - Added robust support for all arrow keys and special keys (home, end, page up/down)
   - Ensured consistent behavior between normal and insert modes

3. **Mode Transitions**:
   - Fixed escape key to properly exit all modes and return to normal mode
   - Added proper insert mode entry via i, I, a, A, o, O commands
   - Fixed cursor positioning during mode transitions

4. **Cursor Positioning**:
   - Improved cursor positioning at line ends in different modes
   - Fixed cursor movement between lines of different lengths
   - Ensured mode-specific cursor positioning logic

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Added robust error handling and recovery in buffer operations
   - Improved file loading with support for different line endings
   - Made the implementation more resilient against crashes

6. **Implementation Switching**:
   - Fixed implementation toggling in the switchImplementation function
   - Improved command line flag handling for switching implementations

7. **Buffer Management**:
   - Fixed issue where first title from previous context would persist visually when loading a new context

   - Added recovery mechanisms for buffer operations
   - Improved data isolation between buffer instances

8. **Advanced Motions**:
   - Implemented % for matching bracket navigation

     - Change operations (cw, cb, ce, c$, c0, cc)
     - Yank operations (yw, yb, ye, y$, y0, yy)
   - Fixed "cw" to behave like "ce" as in standard Vim behavior
